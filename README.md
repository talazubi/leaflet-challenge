## Earthquake Data Visualization Using Leaflet 
## Objective 
This project allows us to visualise real-time earthquake data using Leaflet. The application retrieves data from the United States Geological Survey and plots it on an interactive map. For this assignment, i focused on earthquakes that occured in the past day. The map specifies location as circle markers, with the size being proportionate to the magnitude and the color being proportionate to the depth. This assignment conveys proficiency in using Leaflet, HTML and CSS, and Javascript to create the visualizations. Data analytics is an insightful method to creating clear visualizations such as this interactive map.
